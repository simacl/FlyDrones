## Model parameters

LIF neuron parameters follow Shiu P.K. et al., *Nature* 2024, and their open code
(https://github.com/philshiu/Drosophila_brain_model). No code was copied; parameters are cited.

## Browser demo

`docs/vendor/` contains an unmodified copy of three.js r170 and a few of its example modules (MIT, see
`docs/vendor/THREE_LICENSE`). The webcam mode loads MediaPipe Tasks Vision (Apache-2.0) from jsDelivr on demand.

## Optional dependencies

OpenCV, MediaPipe (Apache-2.0; the hand landmark model is downloaded from Google on first use),
pyarrow, pandas, djitellopy, cflib, pymavlink. Optional body: [FlyGym / NeuroMechFly](https://neuromechfly.org)
(EPFL Neuroengineering Lab; not vendored, install from their docs).
